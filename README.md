<h1>Image Classification For E-commerce</h1>

  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>Welcome to the Image Classification For E-commerce project! In this project, we will be building an image classification system for an online retail company. The goal of this system is to classify the contents of uploaded images to ensure that inappropriate or unacceptable images are not displayed on the website.</p>

  <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
  <p>The retail company allows customers to upload photos when submitting product reviews. However, they discovered that many of the uploaded photos were not suitable and should not be visible on the website. The challenge is to develop an image classification system that can automatically predict and classify the content of each uploaded photo.</p>

  <h2>Solution Overview</h2>
  <p>To address the problem, we will build an image classification model that can predict the content of each uploaded photo. We will design a web service architecture that includes a web server, API endpoint, image classification service, and a database. The web service will provide an API that can be easily integrated into the existing e-commerce website.</p>

  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Install Docker: Make sure you have Docker installed on your machine.</li>
    <li>Clone the Repository: Clone the project repository from GitHub.</li>
    <li>Build and Run the Services: Use Docker Compose to build and run the web service containers.</li>
    <li>Access the Web Interface: Open your web browser and navigate to the provided URL to access the e-commerce website.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The project is organized into several modules:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>api</strong>: Contains the code for the web API, including the Flask app, API endpoints, middleware, and utility functions. The <code>templates</code> folder holds the HTML templates for the web interface.</li>
    <li><strong>model</strong>: Includes the code for the image classification service, which processes the uploaded images using the ML model. The <code>tests</code> folder contains the tests for the model module.</li>
    <li><strong>stress_test</strong>: Contains the Locust file for stress testing the system.</li>
    <li><strong>tests</strong>: Includes integration tests and other test utilities.</li>
    <li><strong>docker-compose.yml</strong>: The Docker Compose configuration file that defines the services and their dependencies.</li>
    <li><strong>README.html</strong>: The HTML file that provides an overview and instructions for the Image-Classification-For-E-commerce project.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Testing</h2>
  <p>We have provided both integration and unit tests to ensure the correctness and functionality of the image classification system. Please follow the provided instructions to run the tests and verify the system's behavior.</p>

  <h2>Stress Testing with Locust</h2>
  <p>For stress testing, we provide a Locust file that allows you to simulate multiple users accessing the system concurrently. Complete the file with the desired test scenarios and run the Locust test to evaluate the system's performance and scalability.</p>

  <h2>User Feedback</h2>
  <p>Implement the feedback functionality that allows users to provide feedback when the model prediction is incorrect. The feedback will be recorded and stored for future analysis and model improvement.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Congratulations on completing the Image Classification For E-commerce project! You have built a system that can classify the contents of uploaded images and ensure that inappropriate content is not displayed on the website. This solution can greatly improve the user experience and content moderation of the e-commerce platform.</p>
  <p>Feel free to explore and enhance the project further by implementing additional features, improving the model's accuracy, or optimizing the system's performance. Happy coding!</p>
